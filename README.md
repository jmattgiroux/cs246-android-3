Program Description: 

This is an adaptation of the Rock Paper Scissors game I created in Java.
The Rock Paper Scissors game is
"A rock paper scissors game that records the player's winning streak.
After losing or quitting, the player is prompted to input their name.
Upon starting the program, the player can choose to either play or view the top ten high scores.

"Records of all recorded scores are recorded in a file called save.txt
Upon playing, recording your score, restarting the program, and choosing to view the high scores, you will see the score you recorded (provided it's within the top 10 high scores, of course)."
